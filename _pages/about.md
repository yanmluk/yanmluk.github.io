I'm a Ph.D. student in the Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab at Stony Brook University, advised by [Professor Klaus Mueller](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mueller/). My research focuses on visual analytics, causal inference, explainable AI, human-computer interaction, and large language models. Currently, I'm working on projects involving the application of data causality to public health challenges, investigating explainable behaviors of reinforcement learning agents, alongside other ongoing research in diverse applications of visual analytics.

My doctoral research is supported by grants from the American Public Health Association (APHA), the New York State Strategic Partnership for Industrial Resurgence (SPIR) program, and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Southwest Jiaotong University.
